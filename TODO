* Serialize regular expressions
* Serialize methods/member functions? maybe only for plain JS objects and not for classes

* support propsToSerialize to be an array (and exclude it from serialization?)
* Raise correct execption if propsToSerialize is not a function or Array
* Raise correct execption if propsToSerialize element does not exist on serialized object.
* Support using constructor functions to instance objects instead of assigning attributes
